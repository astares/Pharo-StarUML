A data type is a type whose values have no identity (i.e., they are pure values). A programming language data type is a data type specified according to the semantics of a particular programming language, using constructs available in that language. There are a wide variety of programming languages and many of them include type constructs not included as UML classifiers. In some cases, it is important to represent those constructs such that their exact form in the programming language is available. The ProgrammingLanguageData type captures such programming language types in a language-dependent fashion. They are represented by the name of the language and a string characterizing them, subject to interpretation by the particular language. Because they are dependent on particular languages, they are not portable among languages (except by agreement among the languages) and they do not map into other UML classifiers. Their semantics is therefore opaque within UML except by special interpretation by a profile intended for the particular language.

Note that many or most programming language types can be directly represented using other UML classifiers, and such representation makes available deeper semantic analysis.

A ProgrammingLanguageDataType may omit its name. Two ProgrammingLanguageDataType elements without names are not considered equivalent.
