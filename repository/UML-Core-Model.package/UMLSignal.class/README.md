A signal is a specification of an asynchronous stimulus communicated between instances. The receiving instance handles the signal by a state machine. Signal is a generalizable element and is defined independently of the classes handling the signal. A reception is a declaration that a class handles a signal, but the actual handling is specified by a state machine
