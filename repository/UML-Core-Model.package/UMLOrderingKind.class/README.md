Defines an enumeration that specifies how the elements of a set are arranged. Used in conjunction with elements that have a multiplicity in cases when the multiplicity value modify the set. The intent is that the set of enumeration literals be open for new values to be added by tools for purposes of design, code generation, etc. For example, a value of sorted might be used for a design specification.
