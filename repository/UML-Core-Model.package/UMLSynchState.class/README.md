A synch state is a vertex used for synchronizing the concurrent regions of a statemachine. It is different from a state in the sense that it is not mapped to a boolean value (active, not active), but an integer. A synch state is used in conjunction with forks and joins to insure that one region leaves a particular state or states before another region can enter a particular state or states.
