A method is the implementation of an operation. It specifies the algorithm or procedure that effects the results of an operation.

In the metamodel, a Method is a declaration of a named piece of behavior in a Classifier and realizes one (directly) or a set (indirectly) of Operations of the Classifier.

There may be at most one method for a particular classifier (as owner of the method) and operation (as specification of the method) pairing.
