A classifier-in-state characterizes instances of a given classifier that are in a particular state or states. In an activity graph, it may be used to specify input and/or output to an action through an object flow state. ClassifierInState is a child of Classifier and may be used in static structural models and collaborations. For example, it can be used to show associations that are only relevant when objects of a class are in a given state.
