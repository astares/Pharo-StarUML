Specifies a realization relationship between a specification model element or elements (the supplier) and a model element or elements that implement it (the client). The implementation model element is required to support all of the operations or received signals that the specification model element declares. The implementation model element must make or inherit its own declarations of the operations and signal receptions. The mapping specifies the relationship between the two. The mapping may or may not be computable. Realization can be used to model stepwise refinement, optimizations, transformations, templates, model synthesis, framework composition, etc
