A send action is an action that results in the (asynchronous) sending of a signal. The signal can be directed to a set of receivers via an objectSetExpression, or sent implicitly to an unspecified set of receivers, defined by some external mechanism. For example, if the signal is an exception, the receiver is determined by the underlying runtime system mechanisms.
