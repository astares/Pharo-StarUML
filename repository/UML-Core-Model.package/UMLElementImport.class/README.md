An element import defines the visibility and alias of a model element included in the namespace within a package, as a result of the package importing another package. In the metamodel an ElementImport reifies the relationship between a Package and an imported ModelElement. It allows redefinition of the name and the visibility for the imported ModelElement; that is, the ModelElement may be given another name (an alias) and/or a new visibility to be used within the importing Package. The default is no alias (the original name will be used) and private visibility relative to the importing Package.
