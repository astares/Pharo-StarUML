An object flow state defines an object flow between actions in an activity graph. An instance of a particular classifier, possibly in a particular state, is available when an object flow state is ccupied. The generation of an object by an action in an action state may be modeled by an object flow state that is triggered by the completion of the action state. The use of the object in a subsequent action state may be modeled by connecting the output transition of the object flow state as an input transition to the action state. Generally each action places the object in a different state that is modeled as a distinct object flow state.
