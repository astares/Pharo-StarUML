Classifier is the metamodel superclass of Class, DataType, and Interface. All of these have similar syntax and are therefore all notated using the rectangle symbol with keywords used as necessary. Because classes are most common in diagrams, a rectangle without a keyword represents a class, and the other subclasses of Classifier are indicated with keywords. In the sections that follow, the discussion will focus on Class, but most of the notation applies to the other element kinds as semantically appropriate and as described later under their own sections.
