A Primitive defines a predefined DataType, without any relevant UML substructure; that is, it has no UML parts. A primitive datatype may have an algebra and operations defined outside of UML (for example, mathematically). Primitive datatypes used in UML itself include Integer, UnlimitedInteger, and String.

The run-time instances of a Primitive datatype are DataValues. The values are in manyto-one correspondence to mathemetical elements defined outside of UML (for example, the various integers).
