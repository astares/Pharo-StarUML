A state is an abstract metaclass that models a situation during which some (usually implicit) invariant condition holds. The invariant may represent a static situation such as an object waiting for some external event to occur. However, it can also model dynamic conditions such as the process of performing some activity; that is, the model element under consideration enters the state when the activity commences and leaves it as soon as the activity is completed.
