A subactivity state is a submachine state that executes a nested activity graph. When an input transition to the subactivity state is triggered, execution begins with the nested activity graph. The outgoing transitions of a subactivity state are enabled when the final state of the nested activity graph is reached; that is, when it completes its execution, or when the trigger events occur on the transitions.
